  bio: "Daniel W. Berman, Professor and Chair, earned his B.A. from the University of Michigan and his Ph.D. from Yale, both in Classics. His research interests include archaic and classical Greek poetry and myth, mythography, Greeks in the Roman world, and topography and ancient geography. His current research project, “Rome in Greek,” focuses on Greek writers’ representations of the city of Rome during the Principate. His most recent book, Myth, Literature, and the Creation of the Topography of Thebes (Cambridge 2015) explores how Greek mythic texts construct and represent the urban environment of Greek Thebes. He has published articles on the Greek mythographers, Aeschylus, the city of Thebes, the Dirce spring, and related subjects, and also one on herdsmen in Theocritus. His first book, Myth and Culture in Aeschylus’ Seven Against Thebes, was published in 2007 by Edizioni dell’Ateneo, and he is translator from French of a book by Claude Calame, Myth and History in Ancient Greece: The Symbolic Creation of a Colony (Princeton 2003). Dan teaches courses in Greek and Latin language and literature, classical myth, and ancient civilization and culture. He also maintains a teaching interest in Roman archaeology and topography. In 2012-2013 he was Andrew W. Mellon Professor-In-Charge at the Intercollegiate Center for Classical Studies in Rome, where he had taught previously as an assistant professor in 2001-2002 and was also lucky enough to study as an undergraduate."
