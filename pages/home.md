Welcome to the website of the Intellectual Heritage Program, home of the Mosaic curriculum that all Temple undergraduates complete as part of their General Education requirements. 
  
Our humanities seminars - Mosaic I and II - introduce students to foundational texts from cultural and intellectual traditions worldwide. Guiding themes such as "journeys", "faith", "science", and "power" are the basis for reading, interrogating, and relating to texts that continue to shape self and society. Upon completion of the two-semester Mosaic sequence, students will be able to:

- Read in its entirety an unfamiliar and problematic written text (theoretically, historically, or culturally challenging)
- Recognize abstractions, large ideas, and implications associated with difficult written texts
- Make connections across disciplines, history and cultural boundaries
- Construct positions, arguments, and interpretations through textual analysis and evaluation
- Produce thoughtful writing that reflects persuasive position and the conventions of academic discourse.
