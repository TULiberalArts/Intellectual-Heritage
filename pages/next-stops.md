## Study Abroad: The Global Good

The Global Good’s four-week undergraduate seminars offer students the opportunity to complete either Intellectual Heritage I or II, over the summer, in locations around the world. These courses pair our small seminars with frequent field trips to sites of ancient and modern cultural significance. Previous courses have taken place in Rome, Italy; Oviedo, Spain; and Seoul, South Korea. Summer 2018 programs are are being offered in London, England and Rome, Italy. 

Learn more about these summer program opportunities by visiting the [Study Abroad website](https://studyabroad.temple.edu/temple-summer-programs), or contact [Genevieve Amaral](mailto:g.amaral@temple.edu), Associate Director for Special Programs.

## Reacting to the Past (RTTP)
![RTTP Banner]({{site.baseurl}}/media/resized RTTP 1.png){:.img-right}
Several Intellectual Heritage professors regularly incorporate the award-winning Reacting to the Past (RTTP) pedagogy into their Intellectual Heritage courses. Pioneered in the late 1990s at Barnard College, RTTP “consists of elaborate games, set in the past, in which students are assigned roles informed by classic texts in the history of ideas. Class sessions are run entirely by students; instructors advise and guide students and grade their oral and written work. It seeks to draw students into the past, promote engagement with big ideas, and improve intellectual and academic skills” (Reacting Consortium).
