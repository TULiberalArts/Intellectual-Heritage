Our humanities seminars introduce students to foundational texts from cultural and intellectual traditions worldwide. Guiding themes such as "journeys", "faith", "science", and "power" are the basis for reading, interrogating, and relating to texts that continue to shape self and society. Upon completion of the two-semester sequence, students will be able to:

- Read in its entirety an unfamiliar and problematic written text (theoretically, historically, or culturally challenging)
- Recognize abstractions, large ideas, and implications associated with difficult written texts
- Make connections across disciplines, history and cultural boundaries
- Construct positions, arguments, and interpretations through textual analysis and evaluation
- Produce thoughtful writing that reflects persuasive position and the conventions of academic discourse.

## IH 851—Intellectual Heritage I: The Good Life

Students will read important works of world literature, philosophy, and religion, from ancient epics to graphic novels, with a focus on individual well-being. We will ask questions like: What do we value, and why? What makes for happiness? What’s right and wrong? How is what’s good for me defined by my relation to others? What is the purpose of life?

## IH 852—Intellectual Heritage II: The Common Good

Students will read important works of social, political, and scientific thought, with a focus on well-being for societies. We will ask questions like: Where does society come from? How do we balance individual liberty and the public good? What behaviors and practices perpetuate injustice? Can we create a better society? How do power and privilege define our capacity to make change? How do we find truth? Can facts be detached from cultural contexts?
