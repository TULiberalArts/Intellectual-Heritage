## Online Mosaic

The Intellectual Heritage Program runs several online sections of Mosaic I and II each semester. These sections meet only online and may benefit students whose schedule or location makes it difficult to attend class in-person. The curriculum is the same as all other sections of Mosaic (same texts, same expectations of critical reading and writing). Intensive participation in online discussion forums takes the place of traditional seminar discussion.

## ESL

The Intellectual Heritage Program runs several sections of Mosaic I and II each semester that are reserved for students for whom English is a Second Language. Only ESL/Bilingual students may register for these sections. These smaller sections provide additional support to students as they increase their skills in the university context. The curriculum is the same as all other sections of Mosaic, and completion of the courses fulfills the Mosaic requirement in General Education. Eligible ESL students can register for ESL sections via Self-Service Banner. If your registration is blocked but you believe you are eligible, please contact or visit Emily Carlin, whose office is in 214 Anderson Hall.

Please contact Jessie Iwata, Associate Director for Teaching Innovation, with any questions about our ESL sections.

## Intellectual Heritage Tutoring

Drop-in tutoring is available for students taking Mosaic I and II. Our undergraduate peer tutors are available to discuss the readings, and to talk through your essays. Please come prepared with your assignment, your notes, and your text.

Tutoring is held in the IH Lounge, Anderson 215. No appointment is necessary.
