## IH Tutoring
Drop-in tutoring is available for students taking Intellectual Heritage I and II. Our undergraduate peer tutors are available to discuss the readings and to talk through your essays. Bring your assignment, your notes, and your text to discuss with your peer tutor.  Please come to the main Intellectual Heritage offices, Anderson 214, and ask for the tutor.

## Diamond Peer Teaching
The Diamond Peer Teachers (DPT) Program is a competitive program providing undergraduates at Temple the opportunity to experience the challenges and rewards of college-level teaching, to develop their own pedagogical skills by working closely with their faculty mentors, and to provide supplemental instruction in lower-level and GenEd courses.

Intellectual Heritage faculty have frequently served as mentors of Diamond Peer Teachers. Interested students should approach the IH instructor with whom they would like to work. 

For more information, please visit the [Diamond Peer Teacher Program](http://www.temple.edu/vpus/opportunities/peerteacher.htm) page.

Temple Undergraduate Research Forum and Creative Works Symposium (TURF-CREWS)
The Temple Undergraduate Research Forum (TURF-CreWS) offers undergraduate students the opportunity to present original research or creative work to the wider Temple community and beyond--friends, family, peers, professors and more-- at a one-day symposium in the spring of each academic year.  TURF-CreWS’ goal is to inspire students to extend the rigorous intellectual and creative work they begin in the classroom out to the wider world, and to provide them with experience presenting their ideas in a conference setting, where like-minded individuals join to “analyze, critique and advise their social, ideological, or cultural communities”. 

Student work born out of the projects and assignments undertaken in IH courses is well-suited for this forum, and our instructors welcome the chance to mentor students interested in taking their scholarship to the next level.

## IH Online
The Intellectual Heritage Program runs several online sections of Intellectual Heritage I and II each semester. These sections meet asynchronously, only online, and may benefit students whose schedule or location makes it difficult to attend class in-person. The curriculum and workload is the same as all other sections of IH I and II (same texts, same expectations of critical reading and writing). Intensive participation in online discussion forums takes the place of traditional seminar discussion. 

## ESL
The Intellectual Heritage Program runs several sections of IH I and II each semester that are reserved for students for whom English is a Second Language. Only ESL/Bilingual students may register for these sections. These smaller sections provide opportunities for extra practice to students in speaking and listening and in reading closely and analyzing the IH texts, The curriculum is the same as all other sections of IH, and completion of the courses fulfills the Intellectual Heritage requirement in General Education. Eligible students can register for these sections via Self-Service Banner. If your registration is blocked but you believe you are eligible, please contact [Jessie Iwata](mailto:JIwata@temple.edu) or [Douglas Greenfield](mailto:dgreenfield@temple.edu) and include:
- Your name
- TUID
- CRN of the course for which you wish to register

Please contact [Jessie Iwata](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/academics/faculty/braun-iwata-jessie), Associate Director for Teaching Innovation, with any further questions about our ESL sections.
