For students who would benefit from extra support the Intellectual Heritage program offers [tutoring](#ih-tutoring). And if you’re looking for an extra challenge or activity, [Diamond Peer Teaching](#diamond-peer-teaching), the [Temple Undergraduate Research Forum](#temple-undergraduate-research-forum-and-creative-works-symposium-turf-crews) or the [Creative Works Symposium](#temple-undergraduate-research-forum-and-creative-works-symposium-turf-crews) could be just what you need.

## General Education (GenEd) Program
The [General Education (GenEd) Program](https://gened.temple.edu/) offers all Temple University students a liberal education for all undergraduate students, providing a foundation for learning and development practices that help students succeed academically and professionally.

A recent survey of more than 300 employers nationwide conducted by the Association of American Colleges and Universities indicated that the majority of employers seek graduates with 4-year degrees with a mix of deep disciplinary skills and knowledge and a broad base of skills and abilities. Skills and abilities which employers ranked most important for schools and colleges to develop included communication skills, critical thinking skills, the ability to apply abstract theories and ideas to concrete experiences and practices, and problem-solving skills.

## IH Tutoring
Drop-in tutoring is available for students taking Intellectual Heritage I and II. Our undergraduate peer tutors are available to discuss the readings and to talk through your essays. Bring your assignment, your notes and your text to discuss with your peer tutor.  Please come to the main Intellectual Heritage offices, Anderson 214, and ask for the tutor.

## Diamond Peer Teaching
![RTTP 3]({{site.baseurl}}/media/resized RTTP 3.png){:.responsive-img .img-right}
The Diamond Peer Teachers (DPT) Program is a competitive program providing undergraduates at Temple the opportunity to experience the challenges and rewards of college-level teaching, to develop their own pedagogical skills by working closely with their faculty mentors, and to provide supplemental instruction in lower-level and GenEd courses.

Intellectual Heritage faculty have frequently served as mentors of Diamond Peer Teachers. Interested students should approach the IH instructor with whom they would like to work.

## Temple Undergraduate Research Forum and Creative Works Symposium 
The Temple Undergraduate Research Forum (TURF-CreWS) offers undergraduate students the opportunity to present original research or creative work to the wider Temple community and beyond--friends, family, peers, professors and more-- at a one-day symposium in the spring of each academic year. TURF-CreWS’ goal is to inspire students to extend the rigorous intellectual and creative work they begin in the classroom out to the wider world, and to provide them with experience presenting their ideas in a conference setting, where like-minded individuals join to “analyze, critique and advise their social, ideological, or cultural communities”.

Student work born out of the projects and assignments undertaken in IH courses is well-suited for this forum, and our instructors welcome the chance to mentor students interested in taking their scholarship to the next level.
